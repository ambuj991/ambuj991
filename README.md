## 🧠 AI/ML Researcher & Engineer

I specialize in developing and deploying cutting-edge machine learning and AI solutions, with expertise in:

- 🤖 **Large Language Models (LLMs)** - Fine-tuning, optimization, and deployment
- 🔄 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Building knowledge-enhanced systems
- 🧩 **Deep Learning Architectures** - CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
- 📊 **MLOps & Scalable Systems** - End-to-end ML pipelines and infrastructure

Currently a **Machine Learning Researcher** at Subconscious AI, working on next-generation AI applications that push the boundaries of what's possible.
